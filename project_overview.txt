Project Overview

Build a machine learning model using Python that takes emails or messages as input and predicts whether they are spam or not. The project involves several key steps:

Data Collection: Use a publicly available dataset like the SpamAssassin Public Corpus or the UCI Machine Learning Repository's SMS Spam Collection.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for modeling. This includes removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, and tokenizing the text.
Feature Extraction: Transform the text data into numerical features that can be used by ML algorithms. A common approach is to use the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization.
Model Building: Use a classification algorithm like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) to train your spam detection model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate your model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Split your data into training and test sets to assess how well your model generalizes to unseen data.
Improvement: Experiment with different preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, and ML algorithms to improve your model's performance.

Implementation Plan
Data Collection:
Download a spam email dataset.
Data Preprocessing:
Load the dataset into Python using Pandas.
Clean the text data (remove punctuation, make lowercase).
Feature Extraction:
Apply TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into a numerical format.
Model Building:
Split the data into training and test sets.
Train a Naive Bayes classifier on the training set.
Model Evaluation:
Use the test set to evaluate the model's accuracy and other metrics.
Adjust parameters or try different models if necessary.
Improvement:
Implement cross-validation to fine-tune the model.
Explore other classification algorithms for better performance.
